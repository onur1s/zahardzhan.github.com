Steele: Actually my wife had that experience. Maybe one of the reasons I
was less aware of it is that I’m not a particularly good touch typist. But she’d
been away from Emacs for 20 years and then I made one available on her
Macintosh. And she sat down, typed in some stuff, and then said, “How do I

done it and she didn’t know what she’d typed. So she did it again and
watched her fingers and said, “Oh yes, Control-X Control-S.” But she
literally couldn’t remember what the commands were.
